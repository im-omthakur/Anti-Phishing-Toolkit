# Anti-Phishing-Toolkit
This tools helps in flooding a phishing website with garbage username and password strings.With minor adjustments it can work on almost any phishing website.
The basic idea behind this is to bombard the website with garbage values so that the linked database runs out of space.
Which will force the website owner to either shutdown the website or to use real money to buy more storage which this toolkit will eventually eat up XD.
